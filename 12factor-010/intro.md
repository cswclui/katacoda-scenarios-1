## Objective

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate the basic concepts behind of the tenth of 12 Factor App principles, **[Dev/prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)**.

## What is Dev/Prod Parity?

According to the website, [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity), 

*The twelve-factor app is designed for continuous deployment by keeping the gap between development and production small. Looking at the three gaps described above:*

* *Make the time gap small: a developer may write code and have it deployed hours or even just minutes later.*
* *Make the personnel gap small: developers who wrote code are closely involved in deploying it and watching its behavior in production.*
* *Make the tools gap small: keep development and production as similar as possible.*

In other words, Dev/Prod Parity is about making sure the deployment paths among releases are identical and any differences that do exists are in configuration settings for `build,` `release` and target environments for the `run` phases.

## What you'll be doing 

[TBP]

You'll be doing the following steps:

* **Step 1:** Installing the Source Code
* **Step 2:** Installing Jenkins
* **Step 3:** Preparing for Multiple Releases
* **Step 4:** Implementing Dev-Prod Parity Under Jenkins

## Executing command line instructions 

This scenario is completely interactive. The instructions you'll be given will be executed directly in the terminal window that is embedded directly in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. In the steps to come, when you see a command line instruction with a black background and check mark at the end, like so:

![Katacoda command line](12factor-009/assets/command-01.png)

just click on it and the command will execute in the interative terminal window.
