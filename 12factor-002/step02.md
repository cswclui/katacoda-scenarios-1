## Objective
The objective of this lesson is to demonstrate how use and manage enternal dependencies in order to make an applications flexible, scalable and easier to change.

In this lab we're going to compare two version of the lab's demonstration application to learn how control application change using dependency mamagement.

## Key Concept: 12 Factor App - Dependencies
A key concept in the **Dependencies** principle of 12 Factor App is that all external modules, packages or libraries are stored independent of your application and are stored in an external artifact repository. You application will keep a list of of external dependencies and the development framework that you use to program your application will have the capability to download the required dependencies from the give artifact repoistory at runtime.

Under no circumstance should external dependencies be stored in the application's central respository.


## Steps

**Step 1:** Confirm you are in the working directory of the lab's application.

`pwd`{{execute}}

You should see the following output:

`/root/12factor`
