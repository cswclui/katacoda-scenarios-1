## About the demonstration application

This lab uses a demonstration application named, *Pinger*. The purpose of *Pinger* is to report environmental information of a webserver at runtime. We'll be adding features to *Pinger* throughout the labs in order to demonstrate the principles of 12 Factor App. In order to control developement, a new branch will be created in this project's GitHub repository each time a feature set is created.
