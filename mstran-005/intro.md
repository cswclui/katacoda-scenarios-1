## What you'll be doing 

In this scenario you'll get the demonstration MOA up and running as a Kubernetes clsuter container. Then, once the MOA is running, you'll request fortunes from *Fortune Cookies* microservices oriented application.

You'll be doing the following steps:

* **Step 1:** Installing the lesson code
* **Step 2:** Getting the code up and running
* **Step 3:** Exercising the Code
* **Step 4:** Understanding the Code as an Example of a Synchronous Microservice Oriented Application

## Executing command line instructions 

This scenario is completely interactive. The instructions you'll be given will be executed directly in the terminal window that is embedded directly in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. In the steps to come, when you see a command line instruction with a black background and check mark at the end, like so:

just click on it and the command will execute in the interative terminal window.
