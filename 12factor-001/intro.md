## Objective

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate the basic concepts behind of the first of 12 Factor App principles, **[Codebase](https://12factor.net/codebase)**.

## What you'll be doing 

In this lab you'll doing following:

* **Step 1:** Getting the Lab's Code from GitHub
* **Step 2:** Inspecting the General Codebase
* **Step 3:** Installing Dependencies
* **Step 4:** Viewing the Application Code
* **Step 5:** Viewing the Application's Configuration File
* **Step 6:** Running the Unit Tests
* **Step 7:** Running the Application

## Executing command line instructions 

This scenario is completely interactive. The instructions you'll be given will be executed directly in the terminal window that is embedded directly in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. In the steps to come, when you see a command line instruction with a black background and check mark at the end, like so:

![Katacoda command line](12factor-001/assets/command-01.png)

just click on it and the command will execute in the interative terminal window.
