## Objective

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate the basic concepts behind the first of 12 Factor App principles, **[Codebase](https://12factor.net/codebase)**.

## What you'll be doing 

In this lab you'll do the following:

* **Step 1:** Getting the Lab's Code from GitHub
* **Step 2:** Inspecting the General Codebase
* **Step 3:** Installing Dependencies
* **Step 4:** Viewing the Application Code
* **Step 5:** Viewing the Application's Configuration File
* **Step 6:** Running the Application's Tests
* **Step 7:** Running the Application

## Executing command line instructions 

This scenario is completely interactive. The instructions you'll be given will be executed directly in the terminal window that is embedded directly in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. In the steps to come, when you see a command line instruction with a black background and check mark at the end, like so:

![Katacoda command line](12factor-001/assets/command-01.png)

just click on it and the command will execute in the interative terminal window.

## About the demonstration application

This lab uses a demonstration application named, *Pinger*. The purpose of *Pinger* is to report environmental information of a webserver at runtime. We'll be adding features to *Pinger* throughout the labs in order to demonstrate the principles of 12 Factor App. In order to control developement, a new branch will be created in this project's GitHub repository each time a feature set is created.
