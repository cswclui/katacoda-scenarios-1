## Objective
The objective of this lesson is demonstrate how to clone from GitHub the project code you'll be using in this lab.

## Steps

**Step 1:** Get the code from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/reselbob/simplecqrs.git`{{execute T1}}

**Step 2:** Navigate to the working directory of the code just cloned. This directory contains all the assets for the lab's demonstration application.

`cd ~/simplecqrs && pwd`{{execute T1}}


**Step 3:** Check out the `git` branch that contains the source code for this lesson:

`git checkout 03-implement-event-driven-architecture.0.0.1`{{execute T1}}

You'll see output as follows:

```
Branch '01-standard-monolith.0.0.1'
set up to track remote branch '03-implement-event-driven-architecture.0.0.1 from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch '03-implement-event-driven-architecture.0.0.1'

```
