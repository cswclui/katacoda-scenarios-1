## Objective

The objective of this lab is to present and demonstrate the essential principles of microservice design in general and data design for microservices in particular.

The essential principles are:

A microservice...

* **has a single responsility**
* **is discrete**
* **carries its own data**
* **is transportable**
* **is ephemeral**



## What you'll be doing 

In this lab you'll be working with a demonstration microservice named *Fortunes*.  You're going to  analyze the *Fortunes*  code to discover how it supports the essential principles of database design for microservices.

You'll be doing the following steps:

* **Step 1:** Installing the Lab Code from GitHub
* **Step 2:** Examining the Code
* **Step 3:** Running the Code as a Microservice
* **Step 4:** Making the Microservice Transportable

## Executing command line instructions 

This scenario is completely interactive. The instructions you'll be given will be executed directly in the terminal window that is embedded directly in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. In the steps to come, when you see a command line instruction with a black background and check mark at the end, like so:

![Katacoda command line](12factor-010/assets/command-01.png)

just click on it and the command will execute in the interative terminal window.

Click the START SCENARIO button to start.
