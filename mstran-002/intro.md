## Objective

The objective of the secenario is to get an example of a monolithic service installed, up and running and to understand the monolithic nature of the service.

## What you'll be doing 

In this scenario you'll get the demonstration service up and running as a Docker container. Then, once the service is running, you'll add a new user to the service.

You'll be doing the following steps:

* **Step 1:** Installing the lesson code
* **Step 2:** Getting the code up and running
* **Step 3:** Exercising the Code
* **Step 4:** Understanding the Code as an Example of a Monolithic Service

## Executing command line instructions 

This scenario is completely interactive. The instructions you'll be given will be executed directly in the terminal window that is embedded directly in the Katacoda interactive learning environment. In the steps to come, when you see a command line instruction with a black background and check mark at the end, like so:

![Katacoda command line](12factor-010/assets/command-01.png)

just click on it and the command will execute in the interative terminal window.
